This problem can be solved by a constrained DFS, which produces a path from (0,0) to (0,1) through all check-in points at required step. However, the naive algorithm is time consuming. To improve its efficiency, we have to apply several pruning conditions on it. First, if the robot arrives at the check-in point before required step t or is not on check-in point at step t, the sub-routes should be truncated. Also, if the distance between the robot and the check-in point is longer than the remaining steps, the sub-routes are illegitimate and hence pruned. In addition, a significant observation is that, if the path divides the unvisited area into unconnected parts, it will never probe each point exactly once. By implementing the above criteria, the algorithm can achieve a relatively low time cost and pass the online judge.
